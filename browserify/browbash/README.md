# Browserify/Evaporate Demo

cd into this directory and in your command line, run: </br>

```
> ./brow.sh ../classes/glm_model.js
```

Once you ran this run, your directory should have 3 new files: </br>

1. index.html
1. bundle.js
1. main.js

Simply click open the index.html and you should be able to play with the newly-generated HTML by entering in the corresponding values and clicking on the 'H2O Calculate!' button </br>

(...and if nothing works, sample/ contains a working index.html/main.js/bundle.js :P)
