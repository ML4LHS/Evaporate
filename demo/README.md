# Demo Instructions
Here we have several POJOs generated by H2O in the h2o_pojo.py. One is a random forest model (rf_model.java) and the other a generalized linear model (glm_model.java) </br>

To make things easier, we provide the main files (written in JavaScript) that calls each model after they have been converted to JavaScript </br>

We wrote bash scripts to convert each POJO into JavaScript using JSweet, an open-source Java-to-JavaScript compiler </br>

To convert the POJOs, change into the demo directory and run these commands:

```
../bash/main.sh name_of_pojo
```

The JavaScript file should then be produced in the demo/ directory. You can run the main file corresponding to the model using node:
```
node main_file
```
